We want to send the best promotions to encourage buying so we use the features \"Age\", \"Sex\", and \"Money spent each month\" to help us make predictions. Now lets saw you were to just eyeball the data and noticed a pattern with the features. You noticed that older females tend to spend the most money on business clothing. You notice that as age decreases, the amount spent on business clothes decreases.\n",
